# LTH Angular Starter Kit

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5.

Angular Starter Kit with FBAccountKit Authentication, inspired by Ngx Starter Kit but faster by just using Angular core and lazy-load.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
